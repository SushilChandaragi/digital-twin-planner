# Digital Twin Planner

**Digital Twin Planner** is a web-based tool designed to facilitate the modeling, simulation, and management of digital twins for real-world systems. With a focus on usability, extensibility, and robust planning features, this project aims to empower users to create and manipulate digital representations of physical assets or processes.


## Features

- **Model Creation:** Build digital twins by defining system components, parameters, and interactions.
- **Simulation:** Run and visualize simulations to predict system behaviors and outcomes.
- **Planning Tools:** Create, edit, and manage different plans for system evolution or task scheduling.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Intuitive UI with interactive components for easy navigation.
- **Customizable:** Easily extend or adapt for different digital twin use cases.
- **Responsive Design:** Works seamlessly on desktop and mobile devices.

- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SushilChandaragi/digital-twin-planner.git
   cd digital-twin-planner
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Project Locally

3. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   This command will spin up a local server (usually at `http://localhost:3000` or similar). Open your browser and navigate to the displayed URL.

> **Note:** If your project is not using Node.js or npm, please specify the correct setup and run instructions (for example, if it is a purely static HTML/CSS/JS project, simply open `index.html` in your browser).

## Usage

- **Create a New Digital Twin:**  
  Use the interface to define a new digital twin, set parameters, and establish relationships.
- **Simulate Scenarios:**  
  Access the simulation module to test different scenarios and see projected outcomes.
- **Plan and Manage:**  
  Use built-in planning tools to organize, schedule, and manage different versions or tasks.
- **Save & Export:**  
  Save your progress and export models as needed for sharing or future use.
